## üåê Deployment

The application is deployed on **AWS S3 Bucket** and is publicly accessible via a configured domain.  
Additionally, it integrates **Google Notification Service** to send notifications to users.

### Deployment Strategy: Blue-Green Deployment
The deployment uses the **Blue-Green Deployment** strategy, ensuring a controlled and secure process for releasing new application versions. This approach includes two main environments:

1. **Development Environment (Blue):**  
   - Used for testing and validating new features.  
   - Allows exhaustive testing, including unit and integration tests.  
   - User Stories (US) are validated and verified in this environment by the QA team, ensuring they meet the defined acceptance criteria.

2. **Production Environment (Green):**  
   - Once new features are stable and meet the acceptance criteria and QA validations, the application is transitioned to the production environment.  
   - This minimizes downtime and ensures a seamless transition for end-users.

### Validation Process
- The development environment serves as a testing space to ensure the stability and functionality of new implementations.  
- After QA approval and confirmation that the US criteria are met, deployment to production (Green) proceeds.  

This methodology guarantees a stable end-user experience and reduces the risk of production issues.
